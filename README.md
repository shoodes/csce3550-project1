// This is a basic RESTful JWKS server developed in GO featuring an //

// parameters. This project will be improved upon in P2 and P3. //


Run this program using

**Test Client**
Make sure you run the test client on a separate IDE or Terminal instance!

> go run test.go

I apologize if this should be in one file, it wasn't specified if it should all be contained within one file or not. I usually do multiple files as having everything within one main file is messy and doesn't make sense.

If it needs to be in one file, I can gladly reupload this with all the code within one file!
